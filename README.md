# DigiMEDRecords
A website called DigiMEDRecords was created to give people access to their digital medical information going back at least three years.
The user must sign up for an account using their email address and password before being prompted to provide some basic information, such as their height and weight.
The website asks the user to provide their identification number, which is a one-of-a-kind number produced for each user, before allowing them to view all of their prior medical records going back three years and beyond. Also, if the user relocates to a different place and begins seeing a different doctor, the doctor still hasaccess to all the records without any use for hardcopies.
